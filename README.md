GAME MODES -

Single player: 


Easy : The ball is slow and the bots are inefficient. Ideal for beginner players (and Shoam).
Medium : The ball is fast and the bots are slightly more efficient. For players who have played their first game.
Hard : The ball is fast and the bots are very efficient. For players who have been playing for more than a minute.

*Bots have a silver lining on them*

Elongation power-up : 2% probability on collision that bat will increase size to 150% for 10 seconds
Shields Activate : 2% probability that wall collisions will be shielded (no life loss) for 15 seconds
